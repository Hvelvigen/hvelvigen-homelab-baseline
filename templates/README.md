# Templates Library

Welcome to the `templates/` library — the central hub for all reusable, beginner‑friendly, “please don’t make me rewrite this again” templates across the Homelab Baseline.

This folder exists to give you clean, structured starting points for the most common homelab components, without assuming you’re a wizard, a YAML monk, or someone who enjoys reinventing the wheel every Sunday afternoon.

Whether you’re working with Docker, Linux, Windows, Home Assistant, or all of the above in a glorious bricolage of services held together by hope and VLANs, this library is here to save you time, frustration, and your last remaining brain cell.

## What This Folder Contains

Each subfolder inside `templates/` focuses on a specific platform or toolset.

Typical structure:

```
templates/
├── home-assistant/
├── docker/
├── linux/
├── windows/
└── README.md   ← you are here
```

More categories will be added over time.

Each category includes:

- practical, ready‑to‑use templates  
- clear examples  
- lightweight usage notes  
- consistent formatting  
- and a distinct lack of unnecessary complexity

Let's make sure you don’t spend 40 minutes trying to remember how you structured something last time.

## Current Categories

### Home Assistant  
Starter YAML, dashboards, automations, packages, and patterns for accessible, frustration‑free configuration.

### Docker  
Compose templates, container patterns, recommended settings, and structure guidance for internal‑only, production‑lite homelab services.

### Linux  
System setup patterns, service examples, cron snippets, user‑friendly hardening templates, and clean layout guides.

### Windows  
Useful PowerShell templates, service patterns, scripts, and config examples — without diving into 500‑line enterprise policies.

## Using the Templates

1. Navigate to the category you need  
2. Open the template that matches your task  
3. Copy the file or snippet into your own environment  
4. Adjust paths, entities, variables, or service names  
5. Validate, test, and adapt  

These templates aim to be minimal, understandable, and adaptable — not one‑size‑fits‑all magic files.

## Who This Is For

Everyone, genuinely:

- Beginners learning how to structure configs  
- Intermediate users wanting consistency  
- Advanced users who value not starting from zero  
- Future‑you, who absolutely will forget how you did that thing last month  

This repo is educational by design — friendly for newcomers, efficient for veterans.

## Final Notes

The Templates Library is meant to be the “baseline toolbox” — something you can rely on, steal from, extend, and customise without digging through old backups or questionable internet forums.

Explore freely, learn from the patterns, and make it your own.

Happy templating!
