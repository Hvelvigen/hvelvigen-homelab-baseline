# Home Assistant Templates

Welcome to the `templates/home-assistant/` section of the homelab baseline.  
This folder provides clean, reusable, beginner‑friendly templates for common Home Assistant setups — without assuming you already know every YAML quirk known to humankind.

Whether you're just starting out (“Why does indentation break *everything*?”) or you're a seasoned automation wizard with 200+ entities and a small fear of touching `configuration.yaml`, these templates are here to make life easier.

## What This Folder Contains

This directory is structured to grow with your environment.  
Each subfolder focuses on a specific category, with templates written to be:

- lightweight  
- readable  
- adaptable  
- and unlikely to summon the dreaded *Invalid YAML* error

Think of this as the “starter kit” you *wish* existed when you first installed Home Assistant.

### sensors/  
Ready‑to‑adapt templates for common sensor patterns (utility meters, network pings, system stats, etc).

### automations/  
Clean baseline automations with explanations.  
Nothing too wild — just practical examples you can drop in without breaking your weekend.

### scripts/  
Useful HA scripts demonstrating structure, variables, and patterns.

### dashboards/  
Starter dashboard layouts to give you a clean jumping-off point (and avoid the “I added 57 cards and regret everything” phase).

### packages/  
Where full “bundle” examples live — combined sensors, automations, and scripts grouped by purpose.

### examples/  
Small, focused YAML snippets demonstrating specific features.

### intuition/  
A lifestyle and wellbeing centric extension for Home Assistant.

## Using These Templates

1. Browse to the category you need.  
2. Pick a template that matches what you're working on.  
3. Copy it into your own HA config.  
4. Adjust entity names to match your system.  
5. Save → reload → observe results like a scientist awaiting questionable data.  

These templates are intentionally minimal so you can understand the logic behind them — not just copy/paste blindly and hope the universe takes pity on your YAML.

## Who Is This For?

Everyone:

- Beginners who want working examples that aren’t overwhelming  
- Intermediate users who want consistent structure  
- Advanced users who don’t want to reinvent the wheel *again*  
- Future‑you, who absolutely will not remember how you did something six months ago  

No judgement here — Home Assistant YAML is ... a journey.

## Final Notes

This is part of the wider Homelab Baseline project.  
For deeper documentation, reusable patterns, and “why is this like this?” explanations, check the main project’s `/docs` and `/templates` folders.

If you ever feel overwhelmed, take comfort in knowing Home Assistant breaks for everyone eventually — that’s why good templates exist.

Enjoy, explore, and may your YAML always validate.
